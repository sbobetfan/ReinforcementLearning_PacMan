# ReinforcementLearning_PacMan
This was a piece of coursework for the Machine Learning module of my Master's Degree at KCL.

The instructions were to implement a Reinforcement Learning algorithm previously taught to us, in order for a game of PacMan to play itself and win each time. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by how many times PacMan won.

My implementation was successful, achieving a final score of 100%, grade A. 

Note: The file I completed was mlLearningAgents.py.

The file was evaluated by running it using variations on:

python pacman.py -p QLearnAgent -x 2000 -n 2010 -l smallGrid
